# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains files related to a machine learning project. Below is a brief overview of the directory structure:

## Scraping

This subdirectory includes all the files related to data scraping from Unegui.mn and subsequent data preprocessing.

- `data_ingestion.py`: This file contains the code for scraping ads from Unegui.mn and exporting it to `cleaned_data.csv`.
- `Data Visualization and Plotting.py`: This file is used for visualizing the data (not essential to the project).
- `Cleaning_module.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on data preprocessing and cleaning. It is an important step in preparing the data for machine learning.
- `FeatureEngineering_module.ipynb`: This notebook covers feature engineering techniques applied to the dataset. It is essential for improving model performance.
- `Training_module.ipynb`: This notebook contains the training module where machine learning models are built and evaluated.

## data_aos_modified

This directory contains hand-modified cleaned data files.

Please review the notebooks `Cleaning_module.ipynb`, `FeatureEngineering_module.ipynb`, and `Training_module.ipynb` for detailed insights into data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. These notebooks are crucial for understanding the project workflow and decisions made during the process.
